# Overview

This field-level component allows to render a text field as a 'Status badge'. See [Status badge](https://design.pega.com/extend/badge/#Status) documentation.

The value of field will be matched again each variant of the regular expression. The match is case insensitive. If no match is found, the badge will be displayed as the 'info' variant.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Configuration

Constellation has a special handling for the field ID 'pyStatusWork' - to use this component, select a different field (like pyLabel) and set the input property to 'pyStatusWork' instead.
