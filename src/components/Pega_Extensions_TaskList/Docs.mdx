# PegaExtensionsGrid Component Task List

## Overview  
The **PegaExtensionsGrid Task List** is a simple and configurable component designed for tracking task progress. It integrates seamlessly with Pega applications, allowing developers to manage task lists dynamically by fetching data and updating task statuses as needed.

---

## Task List Implementation  

### 1. **Component Usage**  
   - Use the `TaskList` component to render a list of tasks with their labels and statuses.  
   - Tasks can be toggled between completed (`true`) and pending (`false`) statuses.  

### 2. **Data Structure**  
   - The task list is represented as an array of objects with the following structure:  

     
     data: [
       {
         Id: 1,
         Label: 'Project configuration has been completed',
         Status: true
       },
       {
         Id: 2,
         Label: 'Create the project report',
         Status: false
       }
     ];
     ```

   - Each task contains:
     - **Id**: A unique identifier for the task.
     - **Label**: A descriptive label for the task.
     - **Status**: A boolean indicating if the task is completed (`true`) or pending (`false`).  

### 3. **Component Example Usage**  

      <TaskList data={taskListData} />
   }

### Features
Dynamic Rendering: Tasks are rendered dynamically based on the provided data array.
Status Updates: Task statuses can be updated, toggling between completed and pending.
Simple Integration: Easy to integrate with Pega applications or other React-based projects.
5. Notes
Ensure the data prop is correctly passed to the TaskList component with the required structure.
