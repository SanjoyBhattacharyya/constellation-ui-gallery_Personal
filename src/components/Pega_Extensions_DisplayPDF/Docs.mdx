# Overview

the DisplayPDF component renders a PDF document inside a form or partial view in read-only mode.

the PDF binary can be provided inside a property to render the PDF inline inside the form or by a Data Page. If a DP is provided, the pdf will be shown in a modal dialog.

You can turn on / off the toolbar in the PDF viewer and set the width and height of the PDF document. To see the pdf in full width inside the form, use the Form full width template.
